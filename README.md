# Introduction to Getting Started with SQL

Just as humans have brains, and computers have hard drives that store
information, most programs have a storage system that needs to be communicated
with. How do we store and find stored data? In databases, and using _Structured
Query Language_, or SQL. SQL. It can be used with a ton of different databases
like MySQL, Postgres, etc. It powers the logic behind server-side frameworks.
SQL has many variations, but for our lessons, we will be using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). While
there are some minor differences we'll note later on, the fundamentals stay the
same.

In the next several lessons, we're going to learn:

* What SQL is
* How to create and open a database file and table
* The three specific SQLite database types
* What "single source of truth" means in the context of object associations
* Executing SQL code
* How to create advanced queries using aggregator functions
* Relational database mapping in object-oriented programming

In this section, you'll learn how to find information associated with particular
criteria and how to create and manipulate data.
