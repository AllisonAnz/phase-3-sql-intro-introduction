Writing Database Commands to a File

Learning Goals
Write SQL code in your text editor instead of your command line
Learn how to execute SQL code you've written in your text editor against a database you've created

Until now we've been using our SQL commands directly in the terminal 
however you will find yourself writing SQL in a file and executing that file in the 
context of your db 

The more complex our db become, the more tables we add and the more advanced the queries 
we run against them, the harder it becomes to keep track of all 
the sqlite3 prompt in our terminal 

We can write SQL in our text editor and execute it 
allowing us to keep track of our SQL code 
including SQL statements that create tables and query data from those tables 

To write SQL in our text editor and execute that SQL against a specific db 
we'll create files in our text editor that have the 
.sql extention 
Then we can run these files against our db in the command line

Creating a Database and Table

1 . In the terminal, create a database with the following command:

    sqlite3 pets_database.db

Once created, exit the sqlite prompt with the .quit command 

Open up a text editor and create and save a file 
01_create_cats_table.sql

Make sure the new file is saved in the same directory 
were you created the db 

In the file write 
CREATE TABLE cats (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER
); 

You won't be able to view the pet_database.db 
directly in your text editor. This file is the binary representation of the database 
It wont open up in a text editor, but it does open up in the image view app
It is the same way for .db files 
They wont object in your editor, but they can be read by the appropriate db engine 

2. Execute that file in the command line 
   Before running the command below make sure you've exited the SQLite prompt 
   that you were in earlier 

   sqlite3 pets_database.db < 01_create_cats_table.sql

   Confirming our SQL Execution 
   To confirm that the above execution of SQL commmands in our .sql file worked 

   1. In the terminal enter into your Pets db with 

       sqlite3 pets_database.db

    2. Then run .schema command 
       and you should see 

       CREATE TABLE cats (
          id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT,
            age INTEGER
        ); 

Operating on Our Database from the text editor 
To carry out any subsequent action on this database
adding a column to the cats table, dropping the table, creating a new table 
we can create a new .sql file in the text editor and execute them in the same way above 

1. To add a column to our cats table 
   Create a file name 
   02_add_column_to_cats.sql

   and fill it out with 
   ALTER TABLE cats ADD COLUMN breed TEXT; 

   Then execute the file in you command line 
   sqlite3 pets_database.db < 02_add_column_to_cats.sql 

2. Confirm that your execution of the .sql file worked by entering your db in the terminal 
   sqlite3 pets_database.db
   .schema
   and you should see the table include breed column
