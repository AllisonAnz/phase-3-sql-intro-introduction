SQLite Data Types

Describe data typing and how it allows for operations to be performed with predictable results.
List four different types of data you can store in a SQLite database.
Define three specific SQLite database types: Text, Integer, and Real.


Why Do Data Types Matter 
We've learned when we create a table, we need to include a name for it 
as well as defined at least one column 

We define columns in a CREATE statement by including a name and a 
datatype to let SQlite know the kind of data we will be storing there 
The practice of explicitly declaring a type is known as typing 

typing allows us to exercise some level of control over our data 
Typing informs our database of what kind of data we plan to store in 
a column but it also restricts it 

Typing gives us the ability to perform all kinds of operations with predictable results 
Like the abiilty to perform Math operations like SUM 

DataTypes 

Differnt database systems also have different dataypes available 
Which are important and useful to know whenever you dealing with those systems 
SQLite has four basic categories of datatypes 
TEXT 
INTEGER
REAL 
BLOB 

TEXT 
Any alphanumeric character which we want to represent as plain text 

INTEGER 
Anything we want to represent as a whole number 

REAL 
Anything that's a plain old decimal like 1.3 

BLOB 
For now we will not use BLOB 
It is generally used for holding binary data 

Note On SQLite 
To increase it compatibility with other db engines (mySQL or PostgreSQL)
SQLite allows programmers to use other common datatypes outside of the four above 

That is why we refer to the above as categories 
All other common datatypes are lumped into one of the four existing dataypes 

For example INT is a common datatype outside of SQLite. 
SQLite wont complain if you define a column as INT datatype 
it will simply lump it into the INTEGER category and store it as such
